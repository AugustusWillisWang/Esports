The e-sports industry has been a booming industry with thousands of professionals devoting and thousands of sponsors contributing. The trend of e-sports has brought considerable chances and problems.

*Thousands of people are devoted into the e-sports industry.*

At the same time, oppositions and doubts are emerging. Here, we will discuss the rules and control of e-sports industry based on the reality and opinions.

## Should we impose stricter regulations on e-sports?

As more people and assets enter the industry, we must see the chaos that exists in e-sports industry, such as vicious competition, intellectual property damage, personal reputation damage. The confusion is clearly rooted in lack of management and rules.

In addition to the constraints of the industry itself, we find that more and more governments are taking the initiative to play the role of guiders in the e-sports industry.

In China, on the recent two sessions, representatives of all walks of life, including government officials, e-sports investors and electronic economic participants, have made a fierce confrontation on the supervision of the government in the e-sports industry.

For network game, opinions vary among representatives. For example, Hu Wanning, vice chairman of Chinese people's political consultative conference (CPPCC) of Tangshan city, Hebei province, claims more radically that online game is the spirit of drug, so that the online game should be finished with a single blow. While Ma huateng, as the chief executive of the biggest game company in China, definitely talks more about the positive side of online games, but feels a punch in the hand. On the other hand, it is suggested that the game grading system should be improved as soon as possible, to control the children's online time, to regulate the advertising of game companies, and to raise the tax of the game publication. For instance, the representative of the National People's Congress (NPC) proposes that the dissemination of e-sports and online games should be strictly controlled from the national level, with the implementation of hierarchical management and real-name system. It is recommended that the state should formulate relevant regulations to restrict the production of games and advertising links on the mainstream websites, and prevent the induction of teenagers. Additionally, some propose that through raising taxes on the game industry, company will be more cautious to decide on economic issue because they will pay higher expenses to make profits.

*Is e-sports the spirits of drugs?*

Conclusively, in China, with the rapid development of e-sports, the
corresponding regulatory measures and the focus from the government are both far
from satisfactory, compared with South Korea's perfect networking monitoring
measures. Due to the constraints of age and class, Chinese representatives will
focus more on the supervision of the game and the guidance to young people. Most
representatives believe that the teenagers' addiction in e-sports, and the
subsequent economic burden and physiological burden are very harmful for the
development of the youth. Chinese politicians are more conservative and
moderate, still watching the more serious negative effects of e-sports on the
society and citizens, which gives the e-sports industry more space to develop,
but also slows down the pace of imposing supervision on the industry.

*Representatives speak on the two sessions.*

In contradiction, the organizational structure of South Korea can be described by "strict bureaucracy under traditional authority" (Marika Heller). From some Korean TV dramas, news and articles, we can find that the system of South Korea's political and economic organizations is strict and rigorous, such as respect for superior and unconditional obedience. The South Korean club puts a semi-militarized management on players. There is a complete set of rules and regulations inside the club, which are strictly enforced. The activities of the players are arranged by the timetable; at the same time, the individual affairs of the players are also controlled. For example, in the spare time, it is a common situation in China that many professionals have their own living rooms. However, in Korea, in general, only strong star players have the right to live their own life. From the club supervision in Korea, it can be seen that the system of e-sports industry in Korea is perfect and strict. From the state to the club, the rules are graded at different levels, and the restrictions on individuals are very strict.

Korea's e-sports industry started early and developed rapidly, and has become the world's leader of e-sports industry and the most important participant. France, as a late-developing participant in the e-sports industry, has made its own choice on the restraint and control of the e-sports industry.

In the Mar 20, 2016, the France government released a [75 page](http://www.economie.gouv.fr/files/files/PDF/rapport-etape-esport-mars2016.pdf) report on e-sports. The report aims at giving legislative solutions to help French e-sports grow. (Adrien Auxent, 2016)

*A French e-sports team*

It suggests 11 propositions, divided into five main points: the status of competitions, the protection of minors, distribution elements, playerâ€™s status, and structuring e-sports. Under this proposal, for instance, minors would need a parental authorization to play games, along with being informed about the rank of the game they are about to play. Representatives of France still debate about how to control teenagers playing online games. Comparing with Chinese, French government is paying more attention to the e-sports industry, and they are moving forward faster.

In conclusion, the proper supervision of e-sports industry is a consensus among governments. However, the degree and depth of supervision need to be further explored. Too strict control will hurt the enthusiasm of the industry, while too loose management will make the industry continue to develop in an unhealthy direction.

## Could e-sports come into the Olympics?

*Image from leSF Global Executive Summit 2017 Recap*

The leSF has long focused on Olympic inclusion and e-sports recognition. In leSF Global Executive Summit 2017 Recap, they had a deep discussion about the entry of e-sports into the Olympic Games. They agreed that a global game selection policy is needed to accelerate the progress. (Graham Ashton,2017) Why a global game selection policy? Because there are issues that should be determined. How do we select the games that can appear in the Olympic? How do we arrange the agenda to meet different cultural tastes? How can we balance the interests between nations and sponsors?

However, we've taken the first step. The 18th Asian games held in Jakarta, Indonesia in 2018, announced the electronic athletics event will appear as performances at the Asian games, which implies the e-sports finally boarded the great hall. The games selected for the Asian games are divided into team events and individual events. Individual events include Tencent's "Craft Royale", Blizzard's "Hearthstone" and "StarCraft II". While "League of Legends", "Arena of Valor" and "Pro Evolution Soccer 2018" are chosen into group events.

*The announcement of Asian Games claims the selected events.*

After the announcement of the list, Tencent was definitely exuberant due to the fact that half of the selected games belongs to Tencent, after all. Specifically, Arena of Valor, the international edition of Royal Glory, is developed from independent research of Tencent, which undoubtedly encourages the e-sports industry of China. Tencent celebrated the high international recognition in Sina Weibo.

*Posters made by Tencent to celebrate selected games. The characters on the poster are "Competition never fails belief. Three major game products from Tencent have been selected in the 2018 Jakarta Asian Games."*

As the largest comprehensive sports meeting in Asia, the Asian Games follow their criteria and principles to select projects. Therefore, it is no coincidence that the six items enter the Asian Games family. These six events include MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) games, strategy card games, simulated sports games and instant strategy games, covering PC and mobile clients. Only relying on their own popularity cannot fully explain their lucky. In the Olympic Charter, the Olympic spirit is fair competition, mutual understanding, friendship and unity, which requires that the game selected should represent the spirit and idea of Asian Games.

We are delighted to witness the progress, and hopefully wait for the next step.

## How do we place non-professionals and take care of their benefits?

In the world of e-sports, the golden age is 17-25 years old. Once the player gets through that age, his or her response will decelerate, but in the arena, 0.1 second will determine success or failure. Consequently, what can these professors do after retirement?

Some retired players choose to do the live broadcasting or take the coach in the club. For those competing contestants, especially the champion players, are popular among live broadcasting platforms. Some people take the manager positions to continue e-sports life. Some leaves the field, disappearing in the public view.

Though coaching is often the main choice after retirement, the clubs do not provide enough positions for them as a pension. The unbalance between the income of the well-known players and the income of ordinary players causes deformity in the industry. For those less popular players, their way of making a living is relatively inferior to ordinary people owing to the fact that they lack advanced education and working experience in other area.

For instance, "StarCraft" player Lee Jae-Jo, his first appearance in the professional arena was in 2005. He had worked for their famous Korean competition teams. After the military service in 2015, he earned money from live broadcasting. However, because of his mother, he had to work for an internet company as a programmer.

After athletes retired, the government have relevant policy support to assist them to integrate into society. However, though e-sports have been recognized as a formal sports events by the Chinese Sports General Administration, the support of the relevant policies has not been popularized to the retired e-sports players

There is a piece of good news. In September 30th, 2017, the Department of Vocational Education and Adult Education of the Ministry of Education posted the notice on completing the declaration work of advanced vocational schools in 2017. The 13 supplementary specialties were published, including e-sports play and management, which belongs to sports education. This means that e-sports will become a part of formal education in the future. Hunan province will be the first province to formally incorporate e-sports into universities. Additionally, it means more and more teachers and professors are beckoning to retired professionals.

What can government and clubs do to deal with unemployment of retired e-sports professionals?

First of all, players should continue basic and advanced education. Generally, professionals are not good at learning. They quit from high school to join teams, which brings them disadvantages in the recruitment market. The clubs are obliged to provide their player with related training of further education and working.

*Communication University of China (CUC) held the first recruitment meetings of
e-sports subjects.*

Secondly, the heat of electronic competition continues to rise, more and more people emit the voice of e-sports' entry into Olympic. Only in this way, can the competition be standardized. Alongside, the issues, such as taxation, welfare, advertising, of e-sports can be solved legitimately.

Last, mature leagues should be set up. Although the current domestic competitions, such as LPL, have been gradually mature in these years, but compared with three big balls and other formal sports, the fans of e-sports are still limited to network. How to expand the industry's positive influence is a hot but tough problem. At least, mature leagues will guarantee the rights and obligation of players, sponsors and followers. We can learn from Korean, the first nation that prompted the development of e-sports.
