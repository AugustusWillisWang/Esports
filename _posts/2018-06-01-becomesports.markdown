After a one-month farce, Lu Benwei, a game streamer who was accused by cheating in a game called Player Unknown's Battle Grounds, was finally thrown out of the live platform. Even though he had tried very hard to explain away his behavior, the fact that he had used cheating application could not been hidden under the persuasive evidence. It is hard to imagine that such a popular streamer with millions of fans could ended his career in a such shamed way. Just in a night, he had to say goodbye to his fans, as well as his reputation.

## Cheating in E-sports happens frequently

Unfortunately, Lu Benwei is not alone. According to the official announcement of BattlEye, a company who devotes into anti-cheating, their software had caught more than one hundred thousand players cheating in the same game in a week, and this is just a small percentage among all cheaters. Not only in the live stream, even in the professional international competition, cheating scandals are also regularly appeared. In 2014, the French player KQLY was exposed of using automated targeting software in SC: GO. As a result, his team was disqualified from the Dream Hack winter competition, and KQLY leaved the e-sport since then.

Because e-sports is based on computer science, the high-technical-cheating methods are countless. However, that does not mean the extinction of classical tricks. In fact, the gimmicks in traditional sports such as playing fake game and buying the referees, are happening as well. Just a few month ago, during a match of DOTA, the both team were trying hard to lose the game, because they all had a trade with gambling company. The punishment with no doubt was severe, but not enough to prevent such event happening again.

Reviewing the cheating scandal over past ten years, we can reach to a shock but undoubtable conclusion, that cheating in E-sports happens frequently, and it seems a long way to go to end cheating in E-sports.

## Why They cheat?

There are three group people cheating, and each of them cheat for the different reason.

For normal player, most of them cheat just for fun, and to them, using cheating software is as same as using money to buy the victory and joy. They do not feel guilty, because they think they pay for it. To some degree, they are right, but what they do not realize is their behavior may ruin a game. About ten years ago, there was a game called CF, which was very popular in China. However, because the company couldn’t stop cheating in the game, more and more players tend to using cheating apps, and finally they all felt boring and quit the game. If cheating by normal players could not been stopped, the one who was the victim of cheating will soon become the one who cheating in game, and the game would lose its players as same as CF.

For professional players, the main reason they cheat is because pressure. Most professional players trained more than 12 hours a day, and the top players such as Faker trained 16 hours every day. They start playing e-Sports since very young and retired at the average age of 21. Without e-Sport they have no way to earn money, but the percentage of attending a team is lower than 1%. Even for popular star, when they are not in their best condition and loss more games than he usually does, he has to face the abuse from his fans and the risk of being a bench player, which may affect his career. Therefore, most professional players who cheated were caught when they hit the lowest point of their career.

For steamers, everything is about money. Same to the professional players, they need to win to attract their fans. Lu Benwei, for example, was a professional player of LOL before he retired and turned to be a steamer. He is not good at PUBG, but unfortunately, he must have to win to maintain his position in DouYu company. The risk of being caught is not compare with the profit of cheating, which lead to so many steamers cheating.

## How to prevent it?

Just as Italy jurist Beccaric said, “The deterrent power of punishment lies not in the severity of punishment, but in its inevitability.” Therefore, the most effective way to prevent cheating is to freeze every single cheater’s ID as soon as possible. We are pleased to see that more and more companies are devoting into the development of anti-cheating applications. Now the main methods using in anti-cheating includes monitoring abnormal performance, scanning local files, and using special devices.

Monitoring abnormal performance, represented by Valve Anti-Cheat System, scanning all the abnormal performance of each players. If a player’s winning percentage are highly above the average percentage, or if he does a high difficulty motion too often, he will be notice by the system. He will not be accused of cheating at once, but he will under the special monitoring. The system has been proved effective. In 2014, it has caught three players cheating in LAN CS: GO tournament.

Scanning local files is another effective way to find out cheaters. Unlike monitoring abnormal performance, this way is based on a player’s software, rather than his action, which means, if a player equipped the cheating software, even if he did not use it, he would also be caught. The software will scan the player’s local file to find out whether he change them and add some cheating software into it. The famous software ESEA Client is using this technique.

Some other methods like using special devices are created by some company, and we believe, more and more methods will be created to fight against cheating. However, though we have many methods now, it is still not enough for preventing people from cheating.

## Limitations

Those methods mentioned before have many limitations. First of all, all of them are methods to find out cheaters, but the huge number of players makes it difficult to punish every single cheater. You can forbid an ID, but the cheater can use another one. The cost of cheating is cheap; thus, the method is doomed to failure. Unfortunately, many as the limitations those methods have, it is the most mature way we have. Up to now, we have no effective way to punish the producer of the cheating software. Also, it is impossible to fix every possible bug that might be used for cheating. Some documents such as [ESIC Position Paper](http://esportsintegrity.com/2017/04/esports-cheating-esic-position-paper/) has been published, but their effort need further observation.

Also, the accuracy of cheating recognition should be concerned. There are many anti-cheating methods mentioned before, but actually only monitoring abnormal performance are widely used and proved most effective. However, because the method is based on one’s operation and winning percentage, it might wrongly accuse some talent player and cause serious consequence on him. During a competition of OW in 2016, the female player Geguri from the Korea team UW Artisan was accused of cheating because of her unbelievable reaction rate and abnormally precise operation. Nobody believe any human been could play like that, locking the position of her four teammates in a second after a 180 degrees spin. Also, her winning percentage was 80%, highly above the line that people could accept. Under the great pressure, Geguri decided to prove her innocent. In a live show, Geguri played the game in front of the whole world, remade the difficult operations one by one, and finally let the world believed that she was a genius and did not cheat in the game. The story finally came to a happy ending, but the pressure and rumor Geguri had been suffered, could hardly fade.
